# MaÃ«l Brunet

I'm a self-taught french (front-end) web developer and UI designer.
I currently work on a React + Redux codebase, where I focus on maintaining a design system used by all web developers in the team.
My profesionnal interests are centered around JavaScript, design systems and the JAMstack / static-site generators.
