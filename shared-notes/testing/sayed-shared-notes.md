# Build and Create your own

### This is what I think

#### Coding is interesting when you create something interesting with code

#### Coding is interesting when you do something useful with code

#### You will love coding and programming when you understand how a machine executes each piece of code

#### You will love programming when you build something that brings benefits to you and to others

#### You will love programming when you solve problems that are not solvable by something else 

#### You will love programming when you build something that makes life easy

# But it is still not interesting to me ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ maybe strange!

## Keep these words at the back of your head!
#### Build, Create, enjoy, interesting, solving, useful, easy, benefits, advantages, ...
