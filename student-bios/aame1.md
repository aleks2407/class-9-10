##  Hello [everyone](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-9-10/tree/master/student-bios) ! 

### My name is Abdul. 

Well, my full name is `Abduljmedzid` but everyone calls me Abdul here in Belgium. This way, you can also avoid spelling cyrillic the  version of it, too. You're curious how it's written? It's  АбдуЉмеџид. :)





#### Who am I :



I've been born and raised in North Macedonia, but I am of Albanian descent. Furthermore, I have spent my last 15 years commuting in Liège and Brussels...and still counting. :joy:
